##  Overview

This project implements a **high-performance C++ market data system** that streams live **Bybit USDT perpetual futures order books**, parses them using **SIMD-accelerated JSON**, maintains **in-memory order books**, and publishes **compact binary market data** over **Aeron IPC** for ultra-low-latency downstream consumption.

The system is designed to **mimic real HFT market-data gateways**, focusing on **predictable latency**, **zero-copy parsing**, and **scalable symbol handling**.

---

##  What This Project Does

At runtime, the system:

1. Fetches all available **USDT perpetual trading symbols** from Bybit *(startup only)*
2. Opens a **WebSocket connection** to Bybit’s public market data stream
3. Subscribes to **order book updates for all symbols** (batched)
4. Parses incoming JSON using **simdjson**
5. Updates an **in-memory order book** for each symbol
6. Extracts **top-N bid and ask levels**
7. Encodes the data using **Simple Binary Encoding (SBE)**
8. Publishes binary messages via **Aeron shared-memory IPC**
9. Enables downstream systems to consume market data with **microsecond-level latency**

---

##  Installation & Build

# Make the build script executable (one-time)
chmod +x build.sh

---

# Build the entire project
./build.sh


The build script automatically installs all dependencies, builds **simdjson**, **Aeron**, and **SBE**, and compiles the trading bot.

---

#  Running the Application

 - cd build
 - ./trading_bot


---

##  Key Features

1. Live Bybit order book streaming for all USDT perpetual pairs
2. SIMD-accelerated JSON parsing
3. Lock-free in-memory order books
4. Binary serialization using SBE
5. Ultra-low-latency IPC via Aeron
6. Designed like real HFT market-data gateways
7. Scalable, deterministic, and low-jitter processing
