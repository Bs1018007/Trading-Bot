# Unused Files and Folders in T4_bot

## ❌ COMPLETELY UNUSED (Can be deleted)

### 1. **BybitRestClient** (Not used anywhere)
- `include/network/BybitRestClient.h`
- `src/network/BybitRestClient.cpp`
- **Reason**: Included in `main.cpp` but never instantiated or used
- **Action**: Can be safely deleted

### 2. **PerformanceMonitor** (Not used anywhere)
- `include/utils/PerformanceMonitor.h`
- `src/utils/PerformanceMonitor.cpp`
- **Reason**: Included in `main.cpp` but never instantiated or used
- **Action**: Can be safely deleted

### 3. **Generated Java SBE Files** (Wrong language)
- `generated/trading/sbe/*.java` (all Java files)
- **Reason**: Your code uses a custom C++ `SBEEncoder` implementation, not the generated Java files
- **Action**: Can be deleted (or keep `schema/` if you want to regenerate later)

## ⚠️ PARTIALLY USED (Keep but clean up)

### 4. **build/logs/** (Old log files)
- `build/logs/*.log` (old log files from previous runs)
- **Reason**: These are just old log files, not needed for code
- **Action**: Can be deleted (logs are also in `logs/` folder)

### 5. **logs/** (Old log files)
- `logs/*.log` (old log files)
- **Reason**: Historical logs, not needed for code to run
- **Action**: Can be cleaned up periodically

## 📦 THIRD_PARTY (Keep - Required for build)

### 6. **third_party/** (Keep all)
- All third_party folders are needed for compilation
- Even if some subfolders seem unused, they may be needed by build system
- **Action**: DO NOT DELETE

## 🗂️ BUILD ARTIFACTS (Can be regenerated)

### 7. **build/** folder contents
- All files in `build/` can be regenerated by running `./build.sh`
- **Action**: Can be deleted, will be recreated on next build
